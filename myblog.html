                Fletcher's abusive teaching style pushes Andrew to both his physical and emotional limits, causing him to sacrifice relationships and endure relentless torment. 
                After a traumatic car accident and public humiliation, Andrew is expelled from the school but later testifies against Fletcher, leading to the teacher's dismissal.
